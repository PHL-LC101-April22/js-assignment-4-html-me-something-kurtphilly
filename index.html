               <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">Running, and more specifically trail running, has become an outlet to
                  cope and relieve stress,
                  explore new places, challenge my physical and mental abilities and create
                  wonderful memories with friends, new and old. Over the last six years I have had the opportunity to
                  run and take part in races that have become a powerful example of what we can accomplish if we apply
                  ourselves and keep moving forward. I hope to continue my running career while visiting new places and
                  meeting
                  new people toward my destination.

      <h2>Other Interests</h2>
      <h3 id="list-heading">Trails Races</h3>
      <p>I like to run long-distances. Usually 50K or longer. The feeling of finishing a race after running (and
         walking) for 8hr-24hrs is unimaginable.</p>



      <h3 id="list-heading">Public Policy</h3>
      <p>How we shape the world we live in is one of the most critcally important factors to impact each and everyone of
         us. Policy is about trade-offs, we
         ultimately must decide what provides the greater benefit to all, even if the benefit to ourselves is minimal.
      </p>



      <h3 id="list-heading">Coding</h3>
      <p>It is the power to create amazing things: that perform a task or a process repeatedly in perpetuity. To then
         use that piece of code to help
         build something else to perform a more complicated procedure. To do be able to say &quot;I can code&quot;
         means the ability to create amazing things.</p>
